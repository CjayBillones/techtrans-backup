<p>We are pleased to announce a call for participation to the<strong> 3rd Summer School on Practical Wireless Sensor Networks.</strong></p>

<p>The SenseDev&rsquo;17 summer school aims to provide post-graduate students, PhD students, ECR&rsquo;s, and engineers from industry with hands-on knowledge in Wireless Sensor Network&rsquo;s (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) domains. The summer school will provide many examples of successful IoT applications to solve real-world problems, which has a social-impact. A focus will be on the first wirelessly instrumented factory in the Philippines which aims to improve worker safety, and improve production times.</p>

<p>The program of the school is delivered over five days from 20th March to 24th March 2017 The school will combine lectures on fundamental and applied aspects of WSNs with hands-on tutorials, providing the participants with a solid understanding and experience to anchor their research in this field. At the end of the five days&rsquo; participants will have built their first fully-fledged WSN.</p>

<p>The school is hosted by the <strong>University of San Carlos, Philippines</strong>, delivered by<strong> Coventry University,</strong> UK, and sponsored by the <strong>British Council.</strong></p>
