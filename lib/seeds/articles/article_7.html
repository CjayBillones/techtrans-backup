<p>The undergraduate thesis of University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman Civil Engineering alumni qualified for the coveted Alfredo M. Yao Intellectual Property (AMY IP) Awards 2014, with co-inventors Kent Renier Carandang and Rhey Joseph Daway delivering their final presentations last 29 September 2014 at the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) office in Taguig. The National Award eventually went to UP Manila faculty and researcher, Dr. Jose B. Nevado Jr., who developed a novel naturally-derived composition from endogenous plants with anti-inflammatory and anti-diarrheal applications.</p>

<p>The UP Diliman team presented Gaia Dam, which Mr. Carandang and Mr. Daway developed with fellow student, Ralph John Barte, under the supervision of their advisers, Prof. Mark Albert Zarco and Prof. Leonardo Liongson. Gaia Dam is an earth material gabion-type low dam that utilizes a specialized, eco-friendly core material designed for irrigation systems. Its innovative design provides stability against water forces while providing enzymes and acids that can help increase agricultural productivity, improving the yield of farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Carandang and Mr. Daway have been pursuing the patent application and commercialization of their invention by taking part in start-up competitions. For their patent application, they enlisted the assistance of the IP and Technology Transfer Unit of the UP Diliman Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Development (OVCRD).</p>

<p>The AMY IP Awards is an annual competition organized by the PCCI in cooperation with the IP Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) to promote appreciation and application of locally-developed technologies. The competition aims to recognize inventors who contribute to the development of highly innovative technologies that are socially beneficial and sustainable. Nominations are screened prior to the final judging based on uniqueness and originality, readiness for commercialization, and impact and benefits to society. The finalists of the AMY IP Awards 2014 were recognized during the 40th Philippine Business Conference and Expo last 22 October 2014 at the Manila Hotel.</p>
