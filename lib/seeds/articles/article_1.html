<p>The research, which is a simple and low-cost detection and estimation system for ionic contamination, was the master&rsquo;s thesis of Engr. Villanueva, conducted under the guidance of her advisers Dr. Naval of the Department of Computer Science and Dr. Mena of the Department of Mining, Metallurgical, and Materials Engineering. Engr. Villanueva, a scholar of the Department of Science and Technology through the Engineering Research and Development for Technology, obtained her degree in Master of Science in Computer Science in 2014.</p>

<p>The AMY IP Awards is an annual competition organized by the PCCI in cooperation with the IP Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) to promote appreciation and application of locally-developed technologies. The competition aims to recognize inventors who contribute to the development of highly innovative technologies that are socially beneficial and sustainable. This is the fourth consecutive year that a UP Diliman nominee entered the finals, and the second year that it placed in the top three.</p>

<p>The winners of the 2015 AMY IP Awards were awarded during the 41st Philippine Business Conference and Expo last 27 October 2015 at the Marriott Hotel Manila.</p>

<p>A Philippine patent application for the invention was filed last 23 October 2015. The invention was also presented during&nbsp;an exhibit participated into by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Development in Singapore last September, where it garnered interest from potential industry takers.</p>
