<p>The University of the Philippines (UP) exhibited six of its groundbreaking researches at TECHINNOVATION 2014 last 23 to 24 September 2014 at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre. The event, which was organized by Intellectual Property Intermediary Singapore (IPI), served as a technology marketplace where businesses and R&amp;D institutions (RDIs) connect for the purpose of collaboration and technology transfer. Universities from all over Asia also participated as exhibitors of TECHINNOVATION 2014, and UP, represented by Dr. Gonzalo A. Campoamor II (UPD OVCRD-RDUO Director), Ace C. Acosta (UPD OVCRD-RDUO), Agnes May B. Bantigue (UPD OVCRD-RDUO), and Perrose L. Comendador (UPLB CTTE), along with Adamson University, were the only exhibitors from the Philippines. More than a thousand delegates, mostly from the commercial, government, and R&amp;D sector, from all over the world visited the trade fair.</p>

<p>IPI, which organizes the TECHINNOVATION every year, is a non-profit organization under the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry committed to assisting industries in finding the technologies that meet their innovation needs, and assisting RDIs in finding industries willing to adopt and improve their technologies. Through intermediaries such as IPI, technologies are able to complete the full technology transfer cycle, enabling RDIs to deploy their innovations in the public for use and consumption. Aside from showing the current offerings in the R&amp;D sector, the event was also able to show partners and delegates alike what industries need in growing their operations.</p>

<p>A total of twelve Intellectual Properties (IPs) from UP Diliman, through the Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Development (OVCRD), and UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, through the Center for Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurship (CTTE), were included in IPI&rsquo;s Technology Portal (an online Technology Marketplace), while six were exhibited during the technology-matching event. Universities and commercial businesses alike showed interest in adopting the UP technologies and the team was able to accommodate initial questions regarding the IPs through one-on-one meetings during the event. But the work does not end there for Team UP, for they still have a lot to deliver to the interested parties when they return to the country.</p>

<p>The participation is a technology transfer initiative of the UPD-OVCRD, in cooperation with the UP Technology Transfer and Business Development Office (TTBDO) and UPLB-CTTE, and with support from the Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs Office of International Linkages (OVPAA-OIL). By participating in events like this, the OVCRD and other UP Technology Transfer Offices hope to emphasize that UP not only produces groundbreaking researches, but that the University also aims to deploy them for the benefit of the general public. With the looming implementation of the ASEAN Integration in 2015, participation in trade fairs, not just locally but also internationally, should be given importance to be able to promote UP technologies for deployment.</p>
