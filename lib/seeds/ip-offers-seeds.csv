Seamoy®: Seaweed-Based Air Freshener Gel,All-Natural and Antibacterial Seaweed-Based Air Freshener,"Many commercial air-fresheners are made from substances that are harmful to
the nervous system and respiratory tract. These substances can cause nausea,
vomiting, dizziness, watery eyes, and chest pain. Thus the need for healthier and
natural alternatives. Seamoy® is one such alternative.","Seamoy®, a seaweed-based air freshener, uses a minimal amount of chemicals and does not generate any hazardous waste. It makes use of natural seaweeds as base instead of the extracted polysaccharide, thus reducing production costs.
Although the gel produced using whole dried seaweed is not translucent in form, the gel strength is same as that of carrageenan-based gel. The base allows a slow release of the essence, thus prolonging the air-freshener’s shelf life.","The technology is developed for use in the homecare consumer goods sector, particularly in air freshener manufacturing.","With a highly biodegradable residue, Seamoy® is environment-friendly. The addition of citric acid inhibits microbe growth. The freshener also has anti-clogging properties, making it ideal for rooms with air-conditioning units. Finally, unlike commercially available fresheners, Seamoy® can be manufactured in
different shapes and sizes for easier shipping and use.","Growing environmental awareness among consumers has encouraged the
adoption of a healthier “green” lifestyle. Products catering to this growing trend
are readily available in the market. Aside from being cost-effective, this product is a safe and natural alternative to commercial air fresheners.","Marco Nemesio E. Montaño, PhD; Banaag A. Glorioso-Lojera

OraVax,Clay Microencapsulation of Non-infective Pathogens for Oral Vaccine Development,"As with any type of farming, aquaculture’s viability and profitability depend on the volume and quality of the yield. This requires, among other things, that the fish be free from disease to prevent fish deaths that in turn reduce harvest. Factors that cause disease among fish include poor water quality, high density (overcrowding), high water salinity, and the presence of predators such as snails and birds. There are available vaccines, which are administered to the fish by injection, immersion, or oral administration, each having its own advantages and limitations. OraVax involves a process that yields an oral vaccine for fishes that provides both long-term immunization for the fish and ease of administration for the farmers. The technology can also be further improved and applied to other species of livestock.","The technology makes use of a process that enhances the effectiveness of the oral vaccine through the clay microencapsulation of the antigen. The clay protects the antigen so that it remains intact when it reaches the fish’s hind gut, where immunization takes place more effectively. The vaccine can be
incorporated into fish pellets to make administration easier. Compared to fish oral vaccines available in the market, OraVax is more effective owing to the process of microencapsulation.","Veterinary drug development, and fish feed manufacturing.","Available vaccines are administered to the fish by injection, immersion, or oral
Administration. Administration by injection is tedious and may even cause stress to the fish. Immersion allows fingerlings to be vaccinated at an early stage but requires more time and effort compared to oral vaccination. However, oral vaccines in the market are known to be less effective because they provide only short-term protection.

The technology offers an alternative way for vaccinating fishes by combining the advantages of injection and oral vaccines and eliminating their disadvantages. This oral vaccine eases administration and reduces labor and costs. Overall, it can provide users with higher yields and profits.","Aquaculture is practiced to supplement the natural supply of fish, which is not
sufficient to serve the growing global population. While the fish supply harvested from the oceans and seas through traditional fishing has remained at a constant level, many countries now rely on aquaculture to meet demand.
Introducing a vaccine that will protect cultured fishes from disease is highly advantageous and can enable farmers to maximize their harvest.","Anacleto M. Argayosa, PhD; 1 Chelo S.

MAPA: Personality Inventory,Masaklaw na Panukat ng Loob: A Filipino Personality Inventory,"Organizations around the world use personality tests to help make decisions about recruitment and their personnel requirements. Human resources units use such tests to determine whether an applicant is a good fit for the role, and more importantly, the company. The instrument is not only limited to the field of human resources management, but can also be used in counseling, education, and research, among others. Widely used tests are based on what is known as the Five-Factor Model of personality, which aims to account for the five broad personality traits.

The Five-Factor Model of personality traits is considered a breakthrough in personality and personality-related research. Drawing from research strongly suggesting the model’s validity in the Philippine setting, this collaborative effort led to the development of a five-factor instrument operationalizing the model using Filipino trait constructs.","Seven field tests undertaken over a period of three years have produced six successive versions of the inventory, the last of which was considered to have completed the test development process. The item and factor analyses for the sixth and final version, which contains 20 scales grouped into four per factor domain, were performed on a combined sample composed of students from UP Diliman, college students from three tertiary-level institutions in Metro Manila and the provinces, and adults from the Metro Manila area. The reliability of the 20 facet scales ranged from .65 to .81, with 12 being .70 or higher. The test
development process ensured adequacy in content validity, keying balance for each of the scales, and the clarity of the five-factor structure for the 20 facets.","Human resource development, education, psychology, research","This Filipino Personality Inventory complements existing personality tests administered in various fields, providing greater insight for decision-makers and
Their respective firms.","Educators, researchers, and Philippine-based organizations can leverage the five-factor instrument to enhance their work on developing human resource capabilities.","Gregorio E.H. del Pilar, PhD; Christie P. Sio; Louie P. Cagasan; Adrianne John R. Galang; Antonia C. Siy

Gaia Dam,Gabion-Type Low Dam with Eco-Friendly Core Material,"This low-cost and environment-friendly irrigation dam is highly beneficial to small farming communities, which need effective and sustainable systems to manage water supply and deliver sufficient water to their farmlands. It is also
designed to help prevent extreme flooding due to heavy rains that are prevalent in tropical countries such as the Philippines, by minimizing and re-routing the flow of water. The dam utilizes gabion cages as its main structural frame, with recycled concrete cylinders or rocks as filler material. The sturdy cylinders inside the gabion cages provide stability against water forces pushing through the dam.","Irrigation systems in agriculture industry, and green engineering in urban areas.","Irrigation systems in agriculture industry, and green engineering in urban areas.",The green engineering of Gaia Dam aims to help alleviate food and water supply shortages. It can also provide electricity to small communities by incorporating a mini hydroelectric turbine and generator. Farmers will benefit from this inexpensive yet effective irrigation system and impounding dam.,"Globally, agriculture accounts for 3.1% of Gross Domestic Product. This rises to 25.6% of GDP in less developed nations (World Bank). Of the total potential agricultural land, only 18% is irrigated. The remaining 82% represents an opportunity for affordable irrigation methods, especially in developing economies. Rapid population growth in these developing countries also creates a need for better food production, which can be attained through cheaper and easier-to- build irrigation methods such as small-scale dams. This is particularly important as majority of agricultural players are small-scale farmers who do not have the resources to invest in big irrigation projects.","Rhey Joseph S. Daway; Kent Renier M.

CoaTiN®,"Titanium Nitride Thin Film Formation on Metal Substrate by Chemical Vapor
Deposition in a Magnetized Sheet Plasma Source","CoaTiN® relates to titanium nitride (TiN) thin film formation on metal substrate by chemical vapor deposition in a magnetized sheet plasma source. CoaTiN® surmounts the limitations of existing coating techniques through the new process where no heating mechanism is introduced. The film synthesis is relatively short and can be done over a wide substrate surface without sacrificing the film quality. Although the invention demonstrates the capacity of synthesizing TiN for small- sized samples, the wide area plasma could very well serve the coating of larger samples. The short duration of coating the TiN film on metal substrate without the use of heating mechanisms makes this invention very promising for nitriding of metals.","The plasma source is composed of five main parts namely: a production chamber, two plasma limiters, a main discharge vacuum chamber, and an anode. This innovative process overcomes limitations in previous coating technologies without sacrificing the quality of the end-product. No heating mechanism is
introduced, the film synthesis is relatively short and can be done over a wide substrate surface.","Semiconductor industry, metal coating industry, and molding industry. Coating can be applied to tools used in various industries such as medicine, engineering, and manufacturing, among others.","TiN coating has many desirable characteristics, giving it an edge over other coating technology. TiN increases the surface hardness of tools, providing protection against abrasion and the damaging effects of friction during industrial processes. Its non-stick property and ability to maintain tool sharpness provide
increased durability and resistance to wear and corrosion. It also prolongs the
tools’ lifetime while creating better finishes.","A TiN film is a remarkably hard and wear-resistant coating on tools. Due to its chemical inertness, it decreases the rate of abrasive wear during the cutting
process and the chemical interaction between the tool and the work piece. Techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, ion plating, ion beam-assisted deposition, sputtering, and hybrid processes have been used to prepare TiN films. The film produced by these techniques, however, often Exhibits poor adhesion to the substrate. It also requires a high deposition
temperature and lengthy thin film formation but covers a limited substrate surface.","Henry J. Ramos, PhD
