Smart Cardiac Rehabilitation Exercise Device,"Current cardiac rehabilitation methods are problematic. Therapists manually monitor and adjust the exercise intensities. It leads to inaccuracies that may make rehab excessive and harmful, or insufficient and ineffective for patients. Thus, patients are unable to maximize cardiac rehabâ€™s potential benefits. 

Also sessions with the therapists are very costly. Manual supervision means that the number of patients who can be served during rehab is limited by the availability of medical experts. This makes cardiac rehab expensive and inefficient.

The Smart Cardiac Rehabilitation Exercise Device is a stand-alone adaptive exercise training system for cardiac rehabilitation. With this device, rehab sessions becomes safer, easier, and more effective for cardiac patients. Hospitals and other rehab settings can perform more rehab sessions with fewer therapists at lower costs using this device.",HeartSmart.jpg
Semiconductor Material with a Buffer Layer for Improved TeraHertz Radiation Use,"This technology presents a novel structure for semiconductor elements comprising a substrate, a buffer layer, an epitaxial layer, and a process to achieve good adhesion between components. A buffer layer which is lattice-mismatched with the substrate and the intended epitaxial layer have shown to yield good quality epitaxial layers, resulting in better performance, compared to current epitaxial layers or even bulk materials when used as a terahertz (THz) emitter.

The THz gap lies between the infrared and microwave bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the neighboring bands, efficient emitters and detectors have been developed, leading to optical and electronics industries. It is through the development in femtosecond laser that THz waves generation by optical excitation of semiconductor surfaces became readily available and interest in its applications increased.

Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth of this heterostructure is not straightforward due poor sticking efficiency of the epilayer on the substrate and decomposition of the substrate during oxide removal under an arsenic flux.",semiconductor-material-buffer-layer 2.jpg
Rapid Electric Vehicle Charging (Charging in Minutes),"This green technology related to the development of a rapid charging system designed for electric vehicles. It can deliver a full and safe charge in at most thirty minutes. This reduces downtime commonly associated with conventional charging systems. It comes with an in-vehicle electronic management unit that performs battery protection, monitoring, and vehicle-charger communications.",rapid-electric vehicle-charging.jpg
HABtech: Cost Effective Device for the Control of Harmful Algal Blooms,"HABtech aims to control HAB through using clay to directly remove algal and indirectly control nutrient before it causes any negative impact on the marine environment. Clay removes algae species through clay particle-algal cell flocculation and aggregation eventually leading to cell lysis/death.  Clay is naturally occurring and is composed of mineral and organic phases that make up the framework of the clay materials. When clay particles and the algal cells flocculate, they form larger aggregates and eventually settle to the bottom.  As they travel down the water column, the aggregates further entrain other cells.  Clay minerals have been shown to interact with algae cell surfaces which affect cell viability and motility leading to their settlement.

HABtech utilizes local ball clay powder mixed with seawater drawn from the site of proliferation. The resulting slurry is applied and spread to the surface of affected areas. The invention alleviates the harmful effects and minimizes environmental damage caused by HABs in the impacted areas.",HABtech-2.jpg
DNA Probe Kits for the Detection of Bacterial Pathogens,"Fish aquaculture is constrained by different diseases. Diagnosis is achieved through conventional methods such as microscopy, bacterial culture and biochemical tests, which are time-consuming and inaccurate. Endpoint PCR can be an alternative but is limited to qualitative detection coupled with laborious post-PCR processing. This invention is a DNA Probe Kit that offer an alternative approach to disease diagnosis as they comprise of highly specific probes for real-time detection of bacterial pathogens and improved qPCR assay protocol that enables multi-probe, multi-amplicon length and multi-species detection in a single qPCR run. This is a big leap from the conventional qPCR assay that detects only short fragments and single or few species at a time. Hence these kits are essential components of qPCR assay for rapid, accurate and safer pathogen detection.

Biotoxin Adsorption Toxin Tracking (BATT) Device,"BATT Device is a monitoring and research tool that could provide early warning on toxic algal blooms or shellfish contamination by accumulating toxins that are below detection limit. It is practical and cost-effective since the passive sampling device is relatively cheaper compared to the solvents that will be used in the extraction procedures in shellfish analysis. It can also give simpler toxin profiles; there is no toxin metabolism or biotransformation unlike in shellfish. The deployment of this device is relatively simple and requires little training. The device also mimics the filter-feeding nature of bivalves which commonly accumulates toxins. However, unlike bivalves, this device provides a clearer picture of the spatial and temporal occurrence of toxic blooms in the environment providing more information on the origin of the toxins and progression of the bloom.
BATT is an effective monitoring tool for Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PSTs) during algal blooms. ",biotoxin-adsorption toxin-tracking.jpg
Affordable Carbon Paste Electrodes for the Detection of Pesticides and Bio-organic Substances,"The use of this carbon paste electrode (CPE) offers a variety of advantages when specifically used as an electrochemical sensor:

The overall material is relatively cheaper than some other types of electrodes;
The CPE can be used for electro-analytical measurement of many redox active chemical compounds similar to solid-state metallic or crystalline electrodes;
The CPE exhibits exceptional electrochemical properties, such as very low specific capacitance and good conductivity which allows it to detect very low concentrations of the target organic molecules present in aqueous media.",carbon-paste-electrodes.png
