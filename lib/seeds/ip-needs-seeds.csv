Improving Hospital Hand Hygiene Compliance ,"Globally, thousands of people are affected by infections acquired while receiving healthcare. Hand hygiene compliance is essential to avoid transmission of harmful germs and preventing infections. Healthcare workers, caregivers or person involved in patient care have to practice good hand hygiene. Implementing guidelines, training and education are widely used to encourage compliance. Devices such as Biovigil are also designed to help healthcare workers comply with hand hygiene. However, such solutions have their limitations. ","To ensure a high compliance rate, it will be good to have an intuitive system. The solution deployed hospital wards with multiple beds and in nursing homes. We welcome collaboration with industry partners/academic/research institutions and would like to work together to brainstorm other solutions and proposals.","Business Collaboration (Joint Venture, Distribution)",hand-hygiene.jpg,Need-Hand-Hygiene.pdf
A Novel Way to Create Orthopedic Casts,"An orthopedic cast or plaster cast is a protective shell commonly made from ""Plaster of Paris"" or fiberglass. It is used to stabilize and support fractures to aid healing. Plaster of Paris is essentially calcium sulfate hemihydrate, a white powder that forms a paste when it is mixed with water. The paste hardens into a solid and is used to make plaster cast as it is cheap and readily available. Due to the nature of the plaster cast, the skin under the plaster may become dry and itchy. The weight of the plaster cast is also another limitation as it causes discomfort and also restricts movement. ","We welcome collaboration with industry partners/academic/research institutions and would like to work together to brainstorm other solutions and proposals. 

We believe the plaster cast should be:

- Lightweight
- Breathable
- Easy to adjust 
- Low cost
- Fast application (less than 12 hours)
- Tough
- Waterproof/water resistant

Personal Care and Dermatological Formulation for Children,"A company is seeking technology partners to develop a new range of organic and hypoallergenic personal care products suitable for children and teens.  These products includes anti-acne and anti-white spot formulas. There is a wide range of skincare products available in the market which can help to promote healthy skin for adults and may not be suitable for young children. The company is keen to work with researchers who have experience with skincare and dermatology formulation, efficacy studies and pediatric dermatology. The main market/distribution of the new products will be focused in the United States.","The formulation should have the following properties:
- Made from ingredients derived from organic sources
- Dermatologically tested preferably
- Formulated specially for children and teens
Suitable for sensitive skin
 
- The company is also interested in developing the following for children:
- Hairstyling gel/spray – organic formulation, prevents hair fall/loss
- Hair shampoo – organic formulation, easy rinse-off

"Flavors, Colors and Preservatives from Natural Sources","There is a growing demand for naturally sourced ingredients. When reading a product label, consumers prefer their products to use natural ingredients as opposed to artificial or synthetic alternatives. However, for some applications – such as neon blue and other bright colors – there are no known natural alternatives. The company is keen to identify novel additives, materials and ingredient technologies that can be easily incorporated into existing food and beverage products.

Possible approaches include, but are not limited to:

- New and unique ingredients
- Creation of new ingredient from affordable bio-transformations
- Synergistic ingredients that alone do not exceed the interest threshold, but when combined in a product at certain minimum concentrations create a dramatic increase in efficacy and/or function
","Key success criteria:

- Must be naturally occurring or derived from a natural source
- Must have similar efficacy and functionality to current artificial/synthetic equivalents
- Replace current ingredient in product formulations without noticeable change or impact on end-product
- Cost increase of up to 10% over current ingredient is acceptable
- Materials/ingredients must be characterized as edible and safe by an authorized regulatory body
- Proposed solution would be familiar to most consumers and/or have a simple ingredient label

Improvements in Output Consistency of Thermally-generated Aerosol Delivery System,"A company in the UK seeks to identify emerging and alternative applications that improve consistency in the output of the next-generation, thermally generated aerosol delivery system. Such a system has applications in regulated markets such as drug delivery and non-regulated markets such as fragrance delivery. The solution provider should be research group or company that has experience with optimizing manufacturing processes associated with aerosol generation using heat and controlled delivery of the resulting aerosol streams. A spectrum of potential solutions are required to efficiently stabilize active components in the consumable and control unwanted, excess water production as well.","Potential solutions should improve output consistency and could include:

- Stabilization of the active components as solids or deposited liquids in situ until they are 'triggered' to generate aerosol streams (encapsulation, timed-release, temperature protection, etc.)
- Controlled delivery technologies that ‘store’ and selectively release the aerosol streams generated on demand or over a period of time (excess aerosol created initially should be managed, while enabling quick and consistent doses)
- Innovative small heating technologies that are efficient and ensure aerosol consistency (multiple zone control and heating pulsed heating, moving zone heating, etc.)
- Technologies that control the level of moisture during shelf-life and/or in-use life and prevent formation of unwanted steam or excess water (active packaging, buffer systems for moisture, methods to prevent generation of steam, steam traps, cooling mechanisms, etc.)
